# 🌐 TechCon 2024 Website – My ALX HTML Practical Project

Hi! I’m Emmanuel, and this is my personal project for the **ALX Front-End program**. It’s a hands-on HTML project where I’m building a complete multi-page website for a fictional tech conference — **TechCon 2024**.

Through this project, I’m applying the core HTML skills I’ve been learning, while also preparing to take the next step into CSS and JavaScript as I grow as a developer.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to help me practice building a real-world website from scratch using only HTML. I’m creating a fully structured website for **TechCon 2024**, which includes multiple pages, navigation, forms, images, and more.

Each page focuses on a specific aspect of the conference — from its mission and history to its schedule and registration. As I build, I’m learning how to organize content meaningfully using semantic HTML.

## 🗂️ Pages in the Website

The website will include the following core pages:

1. **Homepage (`index.html`)**  
   The first page users see — an intro to TechCon 2024 with links to the rest of the site.

2. **About Page (`about.html`)**  
   Covers the history of TechCon, its mission, and past speakers who’ve shaped the event.

3. **Schedule Page (`schedule.html`)**  
   A clear and accessible schedule showing the events and sessions during the conference.

4. **Register Page (`register.html`)**  
   A registration form where attendees can sign up for the event.

5. **Contact Page (`contact.html`)**  
   Includes contact details, social media links, an embedded Google Map, and a contact form.

## 💡 What I’m Learning

This project is helping me put into practice these key HTML concepts:

- **Page Structure & Semantic Tags:**  
  Using tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to organize content.

- **Headings & Text Content:**  
  Structuring content with `<h1>` to `<h6>`, paragraphs, and emphasis tags like `<strong>` and `<em>`.

- **Navigation & Links:**  
  Linking pages together using `<a>` tags and building simple menus.

- **Tables:**  
  Creating readable, structured tables for the event schedule using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`.

- **Forms:**  
  Building user-friendly forms for registration and contact using `<form>` and input types like `text`, `email`, `checkbox`, etc.

- **Images & Media:**  
  Using `<img>` with descriptive `alt` text, and embedding media like videos and maps.

## 🎨 What’s Next

Right now, I’m focusing on solid HTML structure. But as I move forward in my ALX journey, I plan to:

- 💅 **Add CSS** to style the website, improve layout, and make it responsive.
- ⚙️ **Use JavaScript** to add interactivity — like form validation, animations, and dynamic behavior.

This project is just the beginning. I'm excited to keep building on it as I learn more!

## 🚀 Personal Goals

By completing this project, I’m gaining:

- Confidence writing clean, semantic HTML
- A stronger understanding of how websites are structured
- A solid foundation to move into CSS, JavaScript, and eventually full-stack development

## 📝 Final Note

This is part of my **ALX Front-End Curriculum**, but I’m also using it as a real portfolio piece to showcase what I’ve learned so far. I'm proud of the progress I’ve made — and this project marks the start of many more to come.
